# How to use custom ReportParametersObject to filter detail reports ( DetailReportBand )


<p>This example demonstrates how to show a filter dialog that can filter a detail report before showing the report preview. For this purpose, a custom ReportParametersObject - <strong>MyReportParametersObject</strong> - is created and assigned to the report. This class contains two properties - StartDate and EndDate. They are not used in the MyReportParametersObject.GetCriteria method, because it is required to filter the detail report, not the master one. The filtering is performed in the <strong>BeforePrint</strong> script of the detail report band (see <strong>Script.txt</strong>). The MyReportParametersObject is accessed via the <strong>XafReport.ReportParametersObject</strong> property, and values of its StartDate and EndDate properties are used to create a FilterString for the detail report.<br />The example uses the legacy <strong>Reports Module</strong>. The same approach can be used for the <strong>Reports V2 Module</strong>, but the Report Parameters Object should be created and associated with your report in accordance to the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/CustomDocument113594.aspx">Data Filtering in Reports V2</a> topic. Also, the object should be accessed in report scripts in a different way - see <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/CustomDocument114451.aspx">How to: Access the Report Parameters Object in Report Scripts</a>.</p>
